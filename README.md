# Automated VDC
This project contains a sample starter Virtual Datacenter (VDC), which follows a Hub & Spoke network topology. Two demo applications (one IaaS, one PaaS) are deployed into it.

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/ericvan/VDC/_apis/build/status/vdc-terraform-apply-simple-ci?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/ericvan/VDC/_build/latest?definitionId=72&branchName=master)

## TL;DR, give me the Quickstart
To get started you just need [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (to get that I use [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) on Linux & macOS and [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/terraform) on Windows) and [Azure CLI](http://aka.ms/azure-cli), you can use a shell of your choice. Make sure you have the latest version of Azure CLI. This requires some tailored work on Linux (see http://aka.ms/azure-cli) e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu:   
`curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash`    

Of course you'll need an [Azure subscription](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) to deploy to. Clone this repo:  
`git clone https://github.com/geekzter/azure-vdc.git`  
`cd azure-vdc/terraform`  

Login with Azure CLI:  
`az login`   

This also authenticates the Terraform [azurerm](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/azure_cli.html) provider when working interactively. Optionally, you can select the subscription to target:  
`az account set --subscription 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`   
`ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)` (bash)   
`$env:ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)` (pwsh)   

You can provision resources by first initializing Terraform:   
`terraform init`  

And then running:  
`terraform apply`

The default configuration will work with any shell. Additional [features](#feature-toggles) may require PowerShell. Make sure you clean up, these are quite a number of resources (see [disclaimer](#disclaimer)).

## Architecture
### Infrastructure
![alt text](diagram.png "Network view")

This repo deploys the following components:

- A hub network with subnets for shared components (dmz, mgmt, etc)
- Azure Firewall used as Internet Access Gateway (egress, outbound FQDN whitelisting)
- Application Gateway as Web Application Firewall (WAF, HTTP ingress)
- A Management VM that is used as jump server to connect to other VM's
- A Managed Bastion as well
- A Point to Site (P2S VPN), with transitive access to PaaS services
- An IIS VM application deployed in a spoke network, with subnet segregation (app, data)
- An App Service web application integrated into another spoke network
  - Ingress through Private Endpoint
  - Egress through VNet integration (delegated subnet)
- Several PaaS services connected as Private Endpoints
  

### Identify flow
![alt text](identity-diagram.png "Identity View")   

Private networking provides some isolation from uninvited guests. However, a [zero trust](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/10/23/perimeter-based-network-defense-transform-zero-trust-model/) 'assume breach' approach uses multiple methods of isolation. This is why identity is called the the new perimeter. With Azure Active Directory Authentication, most application level communication can be locked down and access controlled through RBAC. This is done in the following places:

1. App Service uses Service Principal & RBAC to access Container Registry
1. User AAD auth (SSO with MFA) to App Service web app
1. App Service web app uses MSI to access SQL Database (using least privilege database roles, see `grant_database_access.ps1`)
1. User AAD auth (SSO with MFA) on Point-to-Site VPN
1. User AAD auth to VM's (RDP, VM MSI & AADLoginForWindows extension)
1. SQL Database tools (Azure Data Studio, SQL Server Management Studio) use AAD Autnentication with MFA
1. Azure DevOps (inc. Terraform) access to ARM using Service Principal

### Deployment automation
![alt text](deployment-diagram.png "Deployment View")

The diagram conveys the release pipeline, with end-to-end orchestration by Azure Pipelines (YAML). The pipeline provisions infrastructure, and deploys 2 applications:

- An [ASP.NET Core app](https://github.com/geekzter/dotnetcore-sqldb-tutorial) deployed on PaaS App Service, SQl Database & more
- An [ASP.NET Framework application](https://github.com/geekzter/azure-vdc/tree/master/apps/IaaS-ASP.NET) deployed on IaaS VM's 

The high-level pipeline steps are:

1. Create [Pipeline environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/environments) using multi-stage YAML pipeline
1. Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform   
This diagram only shows resources (App Service, SQL Database & VM's) that participate in downstream  deployments. Many more resources are created that are not displayed.
1. Provision SQL Database
1. Provision App Service (with SQL DB connection string)
1. App Service pulls configured 
[ASP.NET Core app](https://github.com/geekzter/dotnetcore-sqldb-tutorial) container running offline from database
1. Provision Virtual Machines 
1. Import database (PowerShell with Azure CLI)
1. SQL Database pulls bacpac image
1. Swap deployment slots (PowerShell with Azure CLI)   
[ASP.NET Core app](https://github.com/geekzter/dotnetcore-sqldb-tutorial) now uses live database
1. Deploy [ASP.NET Framework application](https://github.com/geekzter/azure-vdc/tree/master/apps/IaaS-ASP.NET)

## Pre-Requisites
This project uses Terraform, PowerShell 7, Azure CLI, ASP.NET Framework (IIS app), ASP.NET Core (App Service app), and Azure Pipelines. You will need an Azure subscription for created resources and Terraform Backend. Use the links below and/or a package manager of your choice (e.g. apt, brew, chocolatey, scoop) to install required components.

## Getting Started
The quickstart uses defauls settings that disables some features. To use all featues (e.g. VPN, SSL domains, CI/CD), more is involved:
1.	Clone repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/geekzter/azure-vdc.git`  
2.  Change to the `terraform` directrory  
`cd terraform`
3.  Set up storage account for [Terraform Azure Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/azurerm.html), configure `backend.tf` (copy `backend.tf.sample`) with the details of the storage account created. Make sure the user used for Azure CLI is in the `Storage Blob Data Contributor` or `Storage Blob Data Owner`role (It is not enough to have Owner/Contributor rights, as this is Data Plane access). Alternatively, you can set `ARM_ACCESS_KEY` or `ARM_SAS_TOKEN` environment variables e.g.  
`$env:ARM_ACCESS_KEY=$(az storage account keys list -n STORAGE_ACCOUNT --query "[0].value" -o tsv)`   
or   
`$env:ARM_SAS_TOKEN=$(az storage container generate-sas -n STORAGE_CONTAINER --permissions acdlrw --expiry 202Y-MM-DD --account-name STORAGE_ACCOUNT -o tsv)`   
4.	Initialize Terraform backend by running  
`terraform init`  
or  
`./tf_deploy.ps1 -init -workspace default`
5.  Customize `variables.tf` or create a `.auto.tfvars` file that contains your customized configuration (see [Features](#feature-toggles) below)
6.  Run  
`terraform plan`  
or  
`./tf_deploy.ps1 -plan -workspace default`  
to simmulate what happens if terraform would provision resources. 
7.  Run  
`terraform apply`  
or  
`./tf_deploy.ps1 -apply -workspace default`  
to provision resources
8.  Create build pipeline to build IIS application, see `Pipelines/iis-asp.net-ci.yml`
9.  Create build pipeline to build App Service application, see `azure-pipelines.yml` located here: [dotnetcore-sqldb-tutorial](https://github.com/geekzter/dotnetcore-sqldb-tutorial/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml)
10.  Create Terraform CI pipeline using either `vdc-terraform-apply-simple-ci.yml` or `vdc-terraform-apply-ci.yml`

## Feature toggles ###
The Automated VDC has a number of features that are turned off by default. This can be because the feature has pre-requisites (e.g. certificates, or you need to own a domain). Another reason is the use of Azure preview features, or features that just simply take a long time to provision. Features are toggled by a corresponding variable in [`variables.tf`](./terraform/variables.tf).
|Feature|Toggle|Dependencies and Pre-requisites|
|---|---|---|
|Azure&nbsp;Bastion. Provisions the [Azure Bastion](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-bastion/) service in each Virtual Network|`deploy_managed_bastion`|None|
|Monitoring&nbsp;VM&nbsp;Extensions. Controls whether these extensions are provisioned: `IaaSDiagnostics`, `MicrosoftMonitoringAgent`, `DependencyAgentWindows`|`deploy_monitoring_vm_extensions`|None|
|Non&#x2011;essential&nbsp;VM&nbsp;Extensions. Controls whether these extensions are provisioned: `TeamServicesAgent` (for VM's that are not a deployment target for an Azure Pipeline), `BGInfo`|`deploy_non_essential_vm_extensions`|PowerShell 7|
|[Network&nbsp;Watcher](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/network-watcher/)|`deploy_network_watcher`|`deploy_non_essential_vm_extensions` also needs to be set. This requires PowerShell 7|
|Security&nbsp;VM&nbsp;Extensions. Controls whether these extensions are provisioned: `AADLoginForWindows`, `AzureDiskEncryption`|`deploy_security_vm_extensions`|None|
|VPN, provisions [Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps)|`deploy_vpn`|You need to have the [Azure VPN application](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2117554) [provisioned](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/openvpn-azure-ad-tenant) in your Azure Active Directory tenant.|
|AAD&nbsp;Authentication. [Configure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad) App Service to authenticate using Azure Active Directory|`enable_app_service_aad_auth`|SSL and a vanity domain needs to have been set up. You also need to create an Azure AD App registration and configure the `paas_aad_auth_client_id_map` map for at least the `default` workspace (see example in [`config.auto.tfvars.sample`](./terraform/config.auto.tfvars.sample))). (Note: Terraform could provision this pre-requiste as well, but I'm assuming you don't have suffiient AAD permissions as this requires a Service Principal to create Service Principals in automation)|
|Grant access to SQL Database for App Service MSI and user/group defined by `admin_object_id`. This is required for database import and therefore application deployment|`grant_database_access`|PowerShell 7|
|Pipeline&nbsp;agent&nbsp;type. By default a [Deployment Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/deployment-groups/) will be used. Setting this to `true` will instead use an [Environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/environments)|`use_pipeline_environment`|Multi-stage YAML Pipelines|
|SSL&nbsp;&&nbsp;Vanity&nbsp;domain. Use HTTPS and Vanity domains (e.g. yourdomain.com)|`use_vanity_domain_and_ssl`|You need to own a domain, and delegate the management of the domain to [Azure DNS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/dns/). The domain name and resource group holding the Azure DNS for it need to be configured using `vanity_domainname` and `shared_resources_group` respectively. You need a wildcard SSL certificate and configure its location by setting `vanity_certificate_*` (see example in [`config.auto.tfvars.sample`](./terraform/config.auto.tfvars.sample)).

## Dashboard

A portal dashboard will be generated:   

![alt text](dashboard.png "Portal Dashboard")

This dashboard can be reverse engineered into the template that creates it by running:   
`templatize_dashboard.ps1`   
This recreates `dashboard.tpl`, which in turn generates the dashboard. Hence full round-trip dashboard editing support is provided.

## Disclaimer
This project is provided as-is, and is not intended as a blueprint on how a VDC should be deployed, or Azure components and Terraform should be used. It is merely an example on how you can use the technology. The project creates a number of Azure resources, you are responsible for monitoring and managing cost. You can configure auto shutdown on VM's through the Azure Portal, with the [Start/stop VMs during off-hours solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-solution-vm-management), or with functions in my [azure-governance](https://github.com/geekzter/azure-governance/tree/master/functions) repo.
